`isomorphic-svg-charts` is a lightweight, environment-agnostic SVG charting library designed to work seamlessly across any JavaScript environment â€” from server-side rendering in Node.js to React Server Components and client-side apps. With **zero dependencies** and no reliance on the DOM, this library allows you to generate high-quality SVG charts in environments where typical charting libraries like D3 would be too heavyweight.

This makes it perfect for headless systems, APIs, and server-side applications where you need to render charts without any browser dependencies.
